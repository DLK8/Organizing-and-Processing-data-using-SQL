## SQL for Data Organization and Preparation

A foundational project focused on using SQL to transform raw data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format.

### Tools Used
 SQL (MySQL â€“ based on project context)

### Project Highlights
- Exploring Data Structures 
  - Reviewed schema and understood table relationships  

- Data Cleaning
  - Applied conditional filters to remove irrelevant or missing entries  
  - Standardized data types and formats  

- Joining Data
  - Combined multiple related tables into a unified dataset using `JOIN` operations  

- Initial Analysis
  - Performed basic aggregations and queries to uncover early insights  

### Outcome
Prepared a clean and well-structured dataset, setting the stage for deeper analysis in tools like Excel, Power BI, or Python.
